# K-Nearest-Neighbor
A supervised machine learning classification algorithm implemented in JavaScript.

Chart.js is used to visualize how K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm works. In this project, data points have two features Humidity and Pressure which relate to the history of weather. The algorithm makes a prediction whether it will rain or not based on the input test data.
